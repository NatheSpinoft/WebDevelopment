class X(Y) “Make a class named X that is- a Y.”
class X(object): def __init__(self, J) “class X has- a __init__ that takes self and J parameters.”
class X(object): def M(self, J) “class X has- a function named M that takes self and J parameters.”
foo = X() “Set foo to an instance of class X.”
foo.M(J) “From foo get the M function, and call it with parameters self, J.”
foo.K = Q “From foo get the K attribute, and set it to Q.”

2. “class ??? has- a __init__ that takes self and ??? parameters.”
3. “class ??? has- a function named ??? that takes self and ??? parameters.”
4. “Set foo to an instance of class ???.”
5. “From foo get the ??? function, and call it with self=??? and parameters ???.”
6. “From foo get the ??? attribute and set it to ???.”
